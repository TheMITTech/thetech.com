<h1>Contributing to <i>The Tech</i></h1>

<p><i>The Tech</i> has a number of writing departments (News, Opinion, Arts,
Campus Life, and Sports) as well as a few non-writing departments
(Photography, Production, Business, and Technology). You're welcome to
become involved in any of these departments, or mix and match.
To get started, simply e-mail <strong><a href="mailto:tt-join@mit.edu">
tt-join@mit.edu</a></strong> telling us who you are and what you're interested in doing.</p>

<p><strong>News:</strong> If you're interested in interviewing people and doing some
reporting, this is the department for you! We'd like to think that we
cover interesting stories that the MIT community wouldn't hear about
otherwise. Occasionally, we even break news that other, larger
newspapers will pick up. (For example, <a href="/2008/05/09/whoi-v128-n25">
Government Declares Some Grad Students Are 'Security Threats'</a>
was picked up by the New York Times.)</p>

<p><strong>Opinion:</strong> Includes MIT topics and current events.
Over the years, our Opinion section has been an important forum for
campus discussion, though lately we've had a shortage of steady
columnists. If you're interested in this department, we would love to
have you.</p>

<p><strong>Arts:</strong> Mostly reviews of movies, exhibits, concerts, albums, books, and
restaurants. We also publish interviews with actors, authors, etc., and
we may be able to set up those kinds of interviews through our press
contacts if you're interested. (And we'll reimburse your movie ticket
or restaurant tab!)</p>

<p><strong>Campus Life:</strong> Currently includes first-person columns about almost any
topic. This section is ever-changing and pretty flexible, so we'd love
to hear your ideas on how to make it more interesting and compelling.
Cartoonists are also a part of the Campus Life Department.</p>

<p><strong>Science:</strong> We cover recent discoveries from MIT and around the world, as well as student perspectives and experiences in science. 
You can gain access to pre-print research, special talks, and expert perspectives. 
If you're interested, don't worry about your level of experience -- we have resources & mentors to help you learn! </p>

<p><strong>Sports:</strong> We cover both MIT and local sports teams.
Writers are also welcome to write sports columns. It is impressive how wide 
an audience our columns reach; so many people with no affiliation to MIT 
write in letters commenting on them.</p>

<p><strong>Photography:</strong> Pretty self-explanatory. We have high quality,
professional digital photo equipment that you get to play with. Additionally, we have 
a complete functioning darkroom with the ability to process both black and white 
and full color.</p>

<p><strong>Production:</strong> The production team is a tight-knit group that lays out
the newspaper, designs infographics and makes all the other departments look good.
Production is where everything gets put together to be proudly displayed to the 
entirety of campus the next day.</p>

<p><strong>Business:</strong> <i>The Tech</i> is financially independent from MIT. We pay all our
printing costs through advertising, which is handled by the Business
Department.</p>

<p><strong>Technology:</strong> The Technology Department literally keeps <i>The Tech</i> up and
running. We have about 25 Macs that need to communicate with several servers in order
to produce every issue. We're looking to automate as many things as possible in 
addition to constantly improving one of the first 100 sites on the World Wide Web.
Most technology work can be done on your own time rather than a set schedule.</p>

<p><strong>Online Media:</strong> The Online Media Department is made up of interactive designers, 
bloggers, videographers, social media specialists, and audiophiles. We explore new mediums of 
journalism and strive to bring journalism into the 21st century. We are <i>The Tech</i>'s newest department 
and have a lot of freedom to take on leadership and new projects.</p>

<p>To become a member of the staff (i.e. be listed on the <a href="/about/staff">masthead</a> and be
eligible for the staff retreat, banquet, and other perks), you must
write three stories (or take three photos or help out with production
for three nights). The magic number is three for most of the
departments. No experience is necessary with any department, we are happy to 
teach you all you need to know. Just e-mail
