<h1>Opinion Policy</h1>

<p>The following information appears on page 4 of each issue of <span
  style="font-style: italic;">The Tech</span>:

<p><strong>Editorials</strong> are the official opinion 
of <i>The Tech</i>. They are written by 
the editorial board, which consists of the Chairman, Editor in
Chief, Managing Editor, Executive Editor, and Opinion Editor.</p>

<p><strong>Dissents</strong> are the opinions of 
signed members of the editorial board choosing to publish their disagreement
with the editorial.</p>

<p><strong>Letters to the editor, columns,</strong>
and <strong> editorial cartoons</strong> are written
by individuals and represent the opinion of the author, not necessarily
that of the newspaper. Electronic submissions are encouraged and should be
sent to <span style="font-style: italic;">tt-opinions@mit.edu</span>. 
Hard copy submissions should be addressed to The Tech, P.O. Box 391529, 
Cambridge, Mass. 02139-7029, or sent by interdepartmental mail to Room 
W20-483.  All submissions are due by noon two days before the date of
publication.</p>

<p>Letters, columns, and cartoons must bear the authors' signatures, 
addresses, and phone numbers. Unsigned letters will not be accepted. 
<i>The Tech</i> reserves the right to edit
or condense letters; shorter letters will be given higher priority. Once 
submitted, all letters become property of <i>
  The Tech</i>, and will not be returned.  Letters, columns, and 
  cartoons may also be printed on <i>The 
  Tech</i>'s Web site and/or printed or published in any format or 
  other medium now known or later that becomes known. <i>The Tech</i> makes no commitment to 
publish all the letters received.</p>

<p><strong>Guest columns</strong> are opinion articles
submitted by members of the MIT or local community and are tagged with "guest 
column." Columns with "staff columnist" below the byline are written by <i>Tech</i> staff.</p>
