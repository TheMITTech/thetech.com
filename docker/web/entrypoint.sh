# This script is meant to be run as the "entrypoint" to the docker container.
# Its purpose is to delete any leftover tmp files from previous docker-compose
# runs. It was copied from http://stackoverflow.com/a/38732187.
#
# Prior to using this entrypoing script, running "docker-compose up" would work
# the first time, but on subsequent runs, I'd get the error "A server is already
# running. Check /usr/src/app/tmp/pids/server.pid." The issue is that the the
# /tmp folder is in the mounted volume and was being persisted when in fact we
# wanted it deleted after every run.
#
# This script fixes that by first deleting the offending file in /tmp before
# starting.
