[![Deploy](https://github.com/TheMITTech/thetech.com/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg?event=workflow_dispatch)](https://github.com/TheMITTech/thetech.com/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

## Development Setup

The recommended way to develop on this website is to use Docker. See
[DEVELOP.md](DEVELOP.md) for more details.

## Development Workflow

1. Make your awesome changes.
2. Add your changes to the Git staging area: `git add <changed_files>`.
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Some message better than this"`.
4. Rebase your changes to make sure you're staying on top of the newest `dev` branch: `git pull --rebase origin dev`.
5. Push to the `dev` branch: `git push origin dev`
6. Ping the Techno Director, to have the changes merged into master, and deployed to the staging/production website.
